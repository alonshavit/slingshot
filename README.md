# Slingshot - Decentralized Transparent Accelerator

## Abstract

[Slingshot](https://www.slinglabs.io/) is a decentralized and transparent accelerator which is manifested in both the physical world and a specially crafted DAO built on top of [Aragon](https://aragon.org/). Unlike any other accelerator, where peer-learning occurs only between the participants, Slingshot is intended to be transparent and open to all. The goal of Slingshot DAO (Slingers DAO) is to match high value projects with protocols, fund projects in a secure and transparent way and ultimately accelerate the Web3 ecosystem development and adoption.


#### **Slingshot’s Structure**



*   **Experts gild** - a small group of industry experts with the following responsibilities: vote on each batch winning team, vote on further funding of teams.
*   **Production gild** -  a small group of community managers in charge of the DAO’s physical events, community relations and electing the Experts gild.
*   **Funding**- will enable lead protocol partners (LPPs) to create recurring token contributions (based on the EIP 1337 standard, similar to [gitcoin grants](https://gitcoin.co/grants/)) to fund their chosen teams in a transparante and secured way (for both sides). 
*   **Staking** - will enable the public community to stake on the winning teams.


#### **Integration With Aragon**
Aragon apps deployed on the testnet including the UI to conveniently elect Experts, fund projects and vote for the winning teams.
